Adversarially verify one design-review finding against the artifact. Default to REFUTED when uncertain.

FINDING id=editor-resize-loses-its-reserved-band
Seat: evidence
Element: --b-sheet, written once in render-b.js openEditor(); b.css:40 .b-field[data-editor-open]{padding-bottom:var(--b-sheet,var(--gap-block))} and @media (max-width:1023px) scroll-padding-bottom
Problem: openEditor() writes --b-sheet only once, and only `if (getComputedStyle(node).position === 'fixed')`. Nothing recomputes it afterwards: render-core.js binds resize to settle() alone, and __TLD.b.settle only re-places the measures. So a window that is narrowed while the editor is open — a laptop window dragged in, a tablet rotated, a split view — docks the sheet to the bottom edge with no band reserved for it. Measured: open at 1440x960, resize to 768x1024 and the panel flips to position:fixed with --b-sheet still unset, so .b-field falls back to var(--gap-block) = 28px of padding-bottom and scroll-padding-bottom falls back to 30px. The document is 2499px against the 3054px it measures when the same editor is opened natively at 768 — 555px of reserved layout simply missing. Scroll to the true bottom and two row Edit controls sit under the sheet with no scroll left to free them (natively opened at 768 the same test strands zero); at 390 after the same resize, one. This is the paid-for class 'floating objects erase what is under them' returning through the one path the gate does not walk: 'the sheet reserves its own band @ 390/768' (interaction-check.mjs:1001) is only ever run on a page that was LOADED at that width, never on one resized into it.
Proposed fix: In render-b.js, replace the one-shot write in openEditor() with a reserve(root) helper and call it from both openEditor() and __TLD.b.settle (which render-core.js already runs on every resize and on fonts.ready): `function reserve(root){ var p = root && root.querySelector('.b-edit'); if(!p) return; if (getComputedStyle(p).position === 'fixed') root.style.setProperty('--b-sheet', (p.offsetHeight + 24) + 'px'); else root.style.removeProperty('--b-sheet'); }` — in settle, resolve root as document.querySelector('.b-field[data-editor-open]'). Then add an assertion to interaction-check.mjs that opens owner-editing at 1440, calls page.setViewportSize({width:768,height:1024}), scrolls to the bottom and requires zero stranded .b-grab and field padding-bottom >= panel.offsetHeight, and the same test in the 390 direction.

Score against this standard: the work of an award-winning design studio that
iterated on this product for months. 10 is that studio's best shipped work.
Benchmarks to hold it against, by name: Linear, Stripe, Vercel, xAI/Grok,
SpaceX. Score the ARTIFACT, not the effort. A polite 8 that should be a 6
makes the panel worthless.

WHAT YOU ARE REVIEWING
Signal Timeline is how one person hands another the plan for a day that
matters. An owner builds the plan; an audience — a couple, their families, a
venue — receives it as something finished. The flagship case is a wedding: the
owner is a planner or the couple themselves, and the people receiving it will
open it once, on a phone, probably while doing something else, and will judge
the whole company by that one screen. Everything from the owner's first empty
project to the printed keepsake on the morning itself is in scope. Timeline
goes first in a suite-wide redesign because it is the surface with the most
feeling in it; whatever wins here becomes the language Home, Notes and Tasks
adopt next.
The audience: Someone organising the most important day of their life, who has never used a.

CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE (do not propose breaking these):
- Palette is exactly 3 colours: Ink #111111, Indigo #4f46e5, White #ffffff, plus tints of those at
  stated alpha. NO other hue may be introduced. Status and hierarchy are
  expressed by ink density, weight and fill, not by colour.
- Type is Geist and Geist Mono at weights 400 and 600 only.
- The locked architecture:
  Nothing. This is greenfield.
- Protected objects (polish, never redesign):
  Nothing. Nothing is protected.
Findings that amount to "add a colour", "add a weight" or "restructure the
locked architecture" are out of scope and will be discarded.
Also out of scope for this engagement:
Auth, billing, the data model, performance work, marketing pages, and anything
in Tasks or Notes beyond noting what the suite will inherit.

MEASURED BASELINE. Two automated gates guard this master and both pass:
- C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\.claude\skills\elevate\scripts\audit.mjs --lab=C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08
  (palette lock, weights, families, WCAG AA contrast against the real
  composited backdrop, hit targets, radii, motion, type ramp, leading)
- C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08\interaction-check.mjs
READ the behaviour gate. Everything it asserts is already proven; a finding
that restates one of those assertions is worthless and will be refuted on
sight. Spend your findings on what automation cannot see.

Before scoring, also read the paid-for defect library at
C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\.claude\skills\elevate\references\lessons.md — those classes have
been found and fixed once already; check whether they are creeping back,
and spend the rest of your attention past them.

ROUND NOTES
Round 8 notes — what changed since you last saw this, and what not to
report as an oversight.

Round 7 fixed eighteen confirmed findings. The ones most likely to look
new to you:

- The field labelled WHEN in the owner's editor is now written by
  setAway(), the single writer of an item's distance, guarded on focus.
  A confirm on an unchanged field is a deliberate no-op.
- Undo of a move no longer throws; it restores focus to the stepper and
  returns the owner to the place they were standing when they made the
  change. Rename, hide and delete now restore focus too.
- The count in the gutter travels with the words it names; only the tick
  stays on the true pixel. Where a row is crowded, a leader runs down the
  rail to say which mark belongs to which row. This is a deliberate
  answer to a real question - argue with it if you disagree, but it is a
  decision, not an oversight.
- The two-column composition now begins at 1024 rather than 1280. The
  geometry inside it is unchanged.
- The contents of the docked editing sheet are capped to a 480px measure
  below 1024.
- "Try again" on the stalled load is wired, with its own live region.
- The ended link says "This link has ended", and its tense follows the
  clock.
- The printed sheet states the ceremonial date once.
- data-spacing is GONE. The console publishes three named decisions, not
  four, because the fourth was never implemented. Do not report its
  absence as a missing feature.
- There is a THIRTEENTH state, owner-undone. It exists so the
  reversibility bar renders filled and can be graded. It is a test
  fixture for the gate as much as a screen; judge it, but know why it is
  there.

Deliberately OPEN, carried from round 6, not an oversight and not a
regression: the owner cannot edit a moment once it has passed. It is a
build, and the last rounds are the wrong place for it. Do not spend a
finding on it.

Refuted in round 7, with reasons - do not simply re-raise these unless
you have new evidence the refuter missed:
- Moving the editor's reserved band to the foot (it puts the undo bar
  off screen and behind Delete in tab order).
- Adding a type breakpoint between 391 and 766 (the real breakpoint is
  701, and the proposed sizes are off the declared ramp).
- Demoting the today rule to spend indigo elsewhere (both the rule and
  the lead tick are named, ratified uses in the lock).
- Deleting one of the two statements of today (it reintroduces the
  unanchored-time defect a prior round paid for).
- Scrolling the measure to follow a move at desk width (the steppers do
  NOT hold still under scroll; it seats Delete under a repeat-press
  point).
- Raising the edit field to the row's type (the field is a single-line
  input; it cannot show a break at any size).

Say plainly what this is: name the score, name what earned it, and name what
still stands between it and 9.5 in terms a founder can act on — is what
remains polish, a build, or a different decision, and roughly how big. Do not
inflate to be kind and do not deflate to look rigorous.

Refute if: it is factually wrong about the frames or the code; it is already handled; it would violate a non-negotiable constraint; it is taste stated as a defect with no argument; the fix would make the work worse; or it restates something the gates already prove. Confirm only if real, specific, and an improvement at a 9.5 bar. Echo the finding id back exactly so the verdict can be matched to its finding.
