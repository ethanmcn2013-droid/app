Adversarially verify one design-review finding against the artifact. Default to REFUTED when uncertain.

FINDING id=publish-is-not-a-ceremony
Seat: Product taste and emotional resonance
Element: state=publish — the whole screen, and the Publish control in the owner bar that reaches it
Problem: This is the one state with an explicit emotional mandate written into its own kicker — THE MOMENT IT BECOMES THEIRS — and driving it, no moment occurs. Pressing Publish on a plan whose own status line already reads 'Live since 15 July' performs no act: the surface swaps instantly to a two-column utility pane holding a preview thumbnail, a 43-character token in a mono field, a Copy button, and a mono aside conceding SENDING COMES NEXT. Nothing is committed, nothing changes state, nothing is handed to anyone, and the bottom half of the window is empty. Every other screen in the chain knows what it is for; this one is a settings panel wearing a headline. It is also the screen an owner is in at the highest-feeling second of their use of the product — the second they give the thing away — and it gives them a clipboard.
Proposed fix: Make Publish an act with a before and an after, and split the two cases the fixture already distinguishes. (a) Not yet live: label the control 'Hand it over'; pressing it composes the unfurl card out of the page the owner is looking at — the count, the date and the day's name settling into the card's geometry over 0.22s on cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1), no scale and no bounce — and lands on a single line of voice type stating what just happened and to whom, 'Mara & Finn can open this now.', with the link and Copy beneath it and the status line now reading 'Live since 16 July' as a true fact rather than a preset. (b) Already live: the same route leads instead with 'They have had this since 15 July', the primary control is Copy the link, and no ceremony replays — a ceremony performed twice for one event is theatre and costs more than it earns. Keep SENDING COMES NEXT; honesty about the unbuilt half is the right call and should stay.

Score against this standard: the work of an award-winning design studio that
iterated on this product for months. 10 is that studio's best shipped work.
Benchmarks to hold it against, by name: Linear, Stripe, Vercel, xAI/Grok,
SpaceX. Score the ARTIFACT, not the effort. A polite 8 that should be a 6
makes the panel worthless.

WHAT YOU ARE REVIEWING
Signal Timeline is how one person hands another the plan for a day that
matters. An owner builds the plan; an audience — a couple, their families, a
venue — receives it as something finished. The flagship case is a wedding: the
owner is a planner or the couple themselves, and the people receiving it will
open it once, on a phone, probably while doing something else, and will judge
the whole company by that one screen. Everything from the owner's first empty
project to the printed keepsake on the morning itself is in scope. Timeline
goes first in a suite-wide redesign because it is the surface with the most
feeling in it; whatever wins here becomes the language Home, Notes and Tasks
adopt next.
The audience: Someone organising the most important day of their life, who has never used a.

CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE (do not propose breaking these):
- Palette is exactly 3 colours: Ink #111111, Indigo #4f46e5, White #ffffff, plus tints of those at
  stated alpha. NO other hue may be introduced. Status and hierarchy are
  expressed by ink density, weight and fill, not by colour.
- Type is Geist and Geist Mono at weights 400 and 600 only.
- The locked architecture:
  Nothing. This is greenfield.
- Protected objects (polish, never redesign):
  Nothing. Nothing is protected.
Findings that amount to "add a colour", "add a weight" or "restructure the
locked architecture" are out of scope and will be discarded.
Also out of scope for this engagement:
Auth, billing, the data model, performance work, marketing pages, and anything
in Tasks or Notes beyond noting what the suite will inherit.

MEASURED BASELINE. Two automated gates guard this master and both pass:
- C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\.claude\skills\elevate\scripts\audit.mjs --lab=C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08
  (palette lock, weights, families, WCAG AA contrast against the real
  composited backdrop, hit targets, radii, motion, type ramp, leading)
- C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08\interaction-check.mjs
READ the behaviour gate. Everything it asserts is already proven; a finding
that restates one of those assertions is worthless and will be refuted on
sight. Spend your findings on what automation cannot see.

Before scoring, also read the paid-for defect library at
C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\.claude\skills\elevate\references\lessons.md — those classes have
been found and fixed once already; check whether they are creeping back,
and spend the rest of your attention past them.

GRADE BY DRIVING, NOT ONLY BY READING FRAMES. Open the master in Playwright
(chromium; import { chromium } from "@playwright/test") at
file://C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08\master.html?v=approach&state=<state> and operate it:
tab through everything, press what looks pressable, exercise the keyboard
model end to end, resize across 390/768/1152/1279/1280/1440, and watch what every
repaint does to scroll position and focus.

Say plainly what this is: name the score, name what earned it, and name what
still stands between it and 9.5 in terms a founder can act on — is what
remains polish, a build, or a different decision, and roughly how big. Do not
inflate to be kind and do not deflate to look rigorous.

Refute if: it is factually wrong about the frames or the code; it is already handled; it would violate a non-negotiable constraint; it is taste stated as a defect with no argument; the fix would make the work worse; or it restates something the gates already prove. Confirm only if real, specific, and an improvement at a 9.5 bar. Echo the finding id back exactly so the verdict can be matched to its finding.
