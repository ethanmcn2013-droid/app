FINDING id=head-register-leaks-to-state-and-wordmark
Seat: type
Element: .b-inert ("NOTHING TO PREVIEW YET", "SENDING COMES NEXT") and .b-who on the publish screen ("WHAT LANDS IN THE MESSAGE", "THE LINK")
Problem: b.css:1296 declares the round-6 fix in its own words: "Uppercase mono is now exclusive to SECTION HEADS... state and provenance sit one ink step behind it" in sentence case at the data letterfit. Two categories still break it. (a) .b-inert is a STATE and renders 11px Geist Mono / lead 1.4 / 0.16em / uppercase / 62% - byte-identical to .b-measureHead, .b-behindLabel, .b-todayLabel and .b-label. On owner-empty it sits top-right, exactly where Preview and Publish live on the flight state, so the reader is handed a section head where a control was. (b) .b-who is the ceremonial 12px/0.20em step that shell.css:56 documents as "the ceremonial top line, and only that"; on publish it is emitted twice as a <p> for column captions (render-b.js:1341, :1348) while the couple's name is emitted as an <h1> at the same 12px/0.20em/uppercase - and b.css:62 drops those captions to fore-62, which is precisely the ink .b-ogWho ("MARA & FINN", inside the card, on the same screen) already uses. On the one screen where the couple's name and the machine's captions appear together, all three are one typographic object with nothing at all separating them. Driven at 1440/1280/1152/768/390; both gates pass throughout, because the audit keys leading and tracking on family|size|role and every one of these derives to role "label".
Proposed fix: Give state its own row in the sub-15 tier using ladders that already exist. Add .b-inert to the b.css:1304 override list (text-transform:none; letter-spacing:var(--track-data); color:var(--fore-62)) so "Nothing to preview yet" and "Sending comes next" read as sentence-case provenance rather than heads. Then split .b-who: keep --size-labelWide / --track-labelWide / --fore for the h1 identity line only, and give the publish captions a new selector .b-pressCap at --size-label / --lead-label / --track-label / --fore-62 - the section-head spec they actually are - replacing h("p.b-who") at render-b.js:1341 and :1348. No new size, weight, family or hue.

Score against this standard: the work of an award-winning design studio that
iterated on this product for months. 10 is that studio's best shipped work.
Benchmarks to hold it against, by name: Linear, Stripe, Vercel, xAI/Grok,
SpaceX. Score the ARTIFACT, not the effort. A polite 8 that should be a 6
makes the panel worthless.

WHAT YOU ARE REVIEWING
Signal Timeline is how one person hands another the plan for a day that
matters. An owner builds the plan; an audience — a couple, their families, a
venue — receives it as something finished. The flagship case is a wedding: the
owner is a planner or the couple themselves, and the people receiving it will
open it once, on a phone, probably while doing something else, and will judge
the whole company by that one screen. Everything from the owner's first empty
project to the printed keepsake on the morning itself is in scope. Timeline
goes first in a suite-wide redesign because it is the surface with the most
feeling in it; whatever wins here becomes the language Home, Notes and Tasks
adopt next.
The audience: Someone organising the most important day of their life, who has never used a.

CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE (do not propose breaking these):
- Palette is exactly 3 colours: Ink #111111, Indigo #4f46e5, White #ffffff, plus tints of those at
  stated alpha. NO other hue may be introduced. Status and hierarchy are
  expressed by ink density, weight and fill, not by colour.
- Type is Geist and Geist Mono at weights 400 and 600 only.
- The locked architecture:
  Nothing. This is greenfield.
- Protected objects (polish, never redesign):
  Nothing. Nothing is protected.
Findings that amount to "add a colour", "add a weight" or "restructure the
locked architecture" are out of scope and will be discarded.
Also out of scope for this engagement:
Auth, billing, the data model, performance work, marketing pages, and anything
in Tasks or Notes beyond noting what the suite will inherit.

MEASURED BASELINE. Two automated gates guard this master and both pass:
- C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\.claude\skills\elevate\scripts\audit.mjs --lab=C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08
  (palette lock, weights, families, WCAG AA contrast against the real
  composited backdrop, hit targets, radii, motion, type ramp, leading)
- C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08\interaction-check.mjs
READ the behaviour gate. Everything it asserts is already proven; a finding
that restates one of those assertions is worthless and will be refuted on
sight. Spend your findings on what automation cannot see.

Before scoring, also read the paid-for defect library at
C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\.claude\skills\elevate\references\lessons.md — those classes have
been found and fixed once already; check whether they are creeping back,
and spend the rest of your attention past them.

GRADE BY DRIVING, NOT ONLY BY READING FRAMES. Open the master in Playwright
(chromium; import { chromium } from "@playwright/test") at
file://C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08\master.html?v=approach&state=<state> and operate it:
tab through everything, press what looks pressable, exercise the keyboard
model end to end, resize across 390/768/1152/1279/1280/1440, and watch what every
repaint does to scroll position and focus.

Say plainly what this is: name the score, name what earned it, and name what
still stands between it and 9.5 in terms a founder can act on — is what
remains polish, a build, or a different decision, and roughly how big. Do not
inflate to be kind and do not deflate to look rigorous.

Refute if: it is factually wrong about the frames or the code; it is already handled; it would violate a non-negotiable constraint; it is taste stated as a defect with no argument; the fix would make the work worse; or it restates something the gates already prove. Confirm only if real, specific, and an improvement at a 9.5 bar. Echo the finding id back exactly so the verdict can be matched to its finding.
