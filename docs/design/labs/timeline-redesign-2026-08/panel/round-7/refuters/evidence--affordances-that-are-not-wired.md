Adversarially verify one design-review finding against the artifact. Default to REFUTED when uncertain.

FINDING id=affordances-that-are-not-wired
Seat: evidence
Element: [data-act="retry"] (render-b.js:1545); data-spacing (master.html body attr, render-core.js presets/controls); .b-switch (render-b.js:476, b.css:577-598)
Problem: Three things on this master present themselves as operable and are not. (1) loading-slow — the state whose whole subject is a failure — offers one action, "Try again". Nothing anywhere handles data-act="retry"; driven, clicking it changes nothing: state stays loading-slow, aria-busy stays "false", no live region speaks, focus parks on the dead button. The behaviour gate asserts only its existence (interaction-check.mjs:2202, `slow.way === 1`). The file itself declares the rule it is breaking: `inert()` exists at line 471 under "Anything not built is inert text, never a focusable promise". (2) data-spacing is one of the four named decisions: it is written into <body data-spacing="measured">, carried by all three presets, and published in the Design Console as a two-option control with a paragraph of help copy ("Even sets the same items at one rhythm. The honest cost of measured is holes."). Zero rules in b.css or shell.css and zero lines in render-b.js read it; driven, ?spacing=even renders byte-identical item tops. The console the founder shows people ships a dead knob. (3) .b-switch is a <span>, tabindex -1, no role, cursor:auto, carrying "Mara & Finn one of three" inside 1px solid var(--fore-16) / border-radius 6px / min-height 32px — the same border colour, radius and height band as .b-act, sitting 560px from three real buttons drawn identically. It reads as the project switcher and is nothing. Its text also concatenates without a separator ("Mara & Finnone of three"), as does the disclosure name ("Behind you3 moments", measured off the AX tree at 390).
Proposed fix: Replace `act("Try again", ...)` at render-b.js:1545 with a wired button: attach a click handler on the loading-slow node that calls `go("loading")` and writes "Trying again." into a .b-live status; or, if a retry cannot be modelled in the lab, use `inert("Try again in a moment")` per the file's own rule. Either implement data-spacing (an `[data-spacing="even"] .b-measure` branch in place() that lays items at index*ROW instead of away*px) or delete it from master.html's body attribute, from all three presets and from __elevate.controls in render-core.js:246-251. Make .b-switch a real control or stop drawing it as one: drop `border`, `border-radius` and `min-height` from .b-switch (b.css:581-584) so it sets as plain text beside .b-where. Add explicit separators: in bar() render `[projectName, " ", h("span", ...)]` and in behindBlock()'s head render the count as `" " + past.length + " moments"`.

Score against this standard: the work of an award-winning design studio that
iterated on this product for months. 10 is that studio's best shipped work.
Benchmarks to hold it against, by name: Linear, Stripe, Vercel, xAI/Grok,
SpaceX. Score the ARTIFACT, not the effort. A polite 8 that should be a 6
makes the panel worthless.

WHAT YOU ARE REVIEWING
Signal Timeline is how one person hands another the plan for a day that
matters. An owner builds the plan; an audience — a couple, their families, a
venue — receives it as something finished. The flagship case is a wedding: the
owner is a planner or the couple themselves, and the people receiving it will
open it once, on a phone, probably while doing something else, and will judge
the whole company by that one screen. Everything from the owner's first empty
project to the printed keepsake on the morning itself is in scope. Timeline
goes first in a suite-wide redesign because it is the surface with the most
feeling in it; whatever wins here becomes the language Home, Notes and Tasks
adopt next.
The audience: Someone organising the most important day of their life, who has never used a.

CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE (do not propose breaking these):
- Palette is exactly 3 colours: Ink #111111, Indigo #4f46e5, White #ffffff, plus tints of those at
  stated alpha. NO other hue may be introduced. Status and hierarchy are
  expressed by ink density, weight and fill, not by colour.
- Type is Geist and Geist Mono at weights 400 and 600 only.
- The locked architecture:
  Nothing. This is greenfield.
- Protected objects (polish, never redesign):
  Nothing. Nothing is protected.
Findings that amount to "add a colour", "add a weight" or "restructure the
locked architecture" are out of scope and will be discarded.
Also out of scope for this engagement:
Auth, billing, the data model, performance work, marketing pages, and anything
in Tasks or Notes beyond noting what the suite will inherit.

MEASURED BASELINE. Two automated gates guard this master and both pass:
- C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\.claude\skills\elevate\scripts\audit.mjs --lab=C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08
  (palette lock, weights, families, WCAG AA contrast against the real
  composited backdrop, hit targets, radii, motion, type ramp, leading)
- C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08\interaction-check.mjs
READ the behaviour gate. Everything it asserts is already proven; a finding
that restates one of those assertions is worthless and will be refuted on
sight. Spend your findings on what automation cannot see.

Before scoring, also read the paid-for defect library at
C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\.claude\skills\elevate\references\lessons.md — those classes have
been found and fixed once already; check whether they are creeping back,
and spend the rest of your attention past them.

GRADE BY DRIVING, NOT ONLY BY READING FRAMES. Open the master in Playwright
(chromium; import { chromium } from "@playwright/test") at
file://C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08\master.html?v=approach&state=<state> and operate it:
tab through everything, press what looks pressable, exercise the keyboard
model end to end, resize across 390/768/1152/1279/1280/1440, and watch what every
repaint does to scroll position and focus.

Say plainly what this is: name the score, name what earned it, and name what
still stands between it and 9.5 in terms a founder can act on — is what
remains polish, a build, or a different decision, and roughly how big. Do not
inflate to be kind and do not deflate to look rigorous.

Refute if: it is factually wrong about the frames or the code; it is already handled; it would violate a non-negotiable constraint; it is taste stated as a defect with no argument; the fix would make the work worse; or it restates something the gates already prove. Confirm only if real, specific, and an improvement at a 9.5 bar. Echo the finding id back exactly so the verdict can be matched to its finding.
