Adversarially verify one design-review finding against the artifact. Default to REFUTED when uncertain.

Seat: Interaction and states
Element: state=loading-slow — act("Try again", false, { "data-act": "retry" }) at render-b.js line 1545
Problem: There is no handler for data-act="retry" anywhere in render-b.js; grep returns exactly one hit, the line that draws the button. Driven at 390x844: press it and nothing at all changes — body text identical, .b-field keeps aria-busy="false", .b-live stays empty, no skeleton returns, no visual acknowledgement of any kind, and three seconds later it is still the same frame. This is the only control on the only screen where the audience meets failure: a phone, in the evening, the plan not arriving. A guest presses it, gets no answer, and has no way to tell whether the product tried. The gate's "and offers a way on" counts the button's existence (slow.way === 1), and the "every control does something" loop, which presses every button and checks that something changed, runs over owner-flight, owner-empty, owner-editing, publish, phone, desk and day — loading-slow and ended are both outside it, which is why an inert button and a screen with zero focusable elements both pass.
Proposed fix: Wire retry in the guest branch the way copy is wired: on press, set .b-field aria-busy="true", swap the stalled block back to the loading frame's own markup (the .b-skel run plus "Bringing in what is ahead."), write "Trying again." into .b-live, keep focus on the button, and after the declared 0.22s easing plus the fixture's stall delay restore the stalled face with .b-live set to "Still not arriving. The plan has not been deleted, and the link still works." Add loading-slow and ended to the state list in the gate's "every control does something" loop, and tighten that loop so a change confined to document.activeElement.className no longer counts as the control having done something.

Score against this standard: the work of an award-winning design studio that
iterated on this product for months. 10 is that studio's best shipped work.
Benchmarks to hold it against, by name: Linear, Stripe, Vercel, xAI/Grok,
SpaceX. Score the ARTIFACT, not the effort. A polite 8 that should be a 6
makes the panel worthless.

WHAT YOU ARE REVIEWING
Signal Timeline is how one person hands another the plan for a day that
matters. An owner builds the plan; an audience — a couple, their families, a
venue — receives it as something finished. The flagship case is a wedding: the
owner is a planner or the couple themselves, and the people receiving it will
open it once, on a phone, probably while doing something else, and will judge
the whole company by that one screen. Everything from the owner's first empty
project to the printed keepsake on the morning itself is in scope. Timeline
goes first in a suite-wide redesign because it is the surface with the most
feeling in it; whatever wins here becomes the language Home, Notes and Tasks
adopt next.
The audience: Someone organising the most important day of their life, who has never used a.

CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE (do not propose breaking these):
- Palette is exactly 3 colours: Ink #111111, Indigo #4f46e5, White #ffffff, plus tints of those at
  stated alpha. NO other hue may be introduced. Status and hierarchy are
  expressed by ink density, weight and fill, not by colour.
- Type is Geist and Geist Mono at weights 400 and 600 only.
- The locked architecture:
  Nothing. This is greenfield.
- Protected objects (polish, never redesign):
  Nothing. Nothing is protected.
Findings that amount to "add a colour", "add a weight" or "restructure the
locked architecture" are out of scope and will be discarded.
Also out of scope for this engagement:
Auth, billing, the data model, performance work, marketing pages, and anything
in Tasks or Notes beyond noting what the suite will inherit.

MEASURED BASELINE. Two automated gates guard this master and both pass:
- C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\.claude\skills\elevate\scripts\audit.mjs --lab=C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08
  (palette lock, weights, families, WCAG AA contrast against the real
  composited backdrop, hit targets, radii, motion, type ramp, leading)
- C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08\interaction-check.mjs
READ the behaviour gate. Everything it asserts is already proven; a finding
that restates one of those assertions is worthless and will be refuted on
sight. Spend your findings on what automation cannot see.

Before scoring, also read the paid-for defect library at
C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\.claude\skills\elevate\references\lessons.md — those classes have
been found and fixed once already; check whether they are creeping back,
and spend the rest of your attention past them.

GRADE BY DRIVING, NOT ONLY BY READING FRAMES. Open the master in Playwright
(chromium; import { chromium } from "@playwright/test") at
file://C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08\master.html?v=approach&state=<state> and operate it:
tab through everything, press what looks pressable, exercise the keyboard
model end to end, resize across 390/768/1152/1279/1280/1440, and watch what every
repaint does to scroll position and focus.

Say plainly what this is: name the score, name what earned it, and name what
still stands between it and 9.5 in terms a founder can act on — is what
remains polish, a build, or a different decision, and roughly how big. Do not
inflate to be kind and do not deflate to look rigorous.

Refute if: it is factually wrong about the frames or the code; it is already handled; it would violate a non-negotiable constraint; it is taste stated as a defect with no argument; the fix would make the work worse; or it restates something the gates already prove. Confirm only if real, specific, and an improvement at a 9.5 bar. Echo the finding id back exactly so the verdict can be matched to its finding.
