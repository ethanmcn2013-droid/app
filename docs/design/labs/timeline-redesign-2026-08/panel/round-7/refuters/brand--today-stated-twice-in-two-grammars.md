Adversarially verify one design-review finding against the artifact. Default to REFUTED when uncertain.

FINDING id=today-stated-twice-in-two-grammars
Seat: Brand and copy
Element: .b-todayLabel in horizon() (render-b.js:125) against the rail's today marker (render-b.js:180); on print, .b-unit plus the same marker plus the footer stamp
Problem: Every surface that draws the measure states today twice, in two grammars, both visible at once and about 700px apart at 1440: "TODAY IS 16 JULY" on the left, "Today, 16 July" on the right. The renderer's own comment claims paper was exempted from exactly this defect, but the printed keepsake is the worst case of it — the sheet dates itself three times, "79 days away on Thursday 16 July 2026", "Today, Thursday 16 July 2026" and "Updated 15 July 2026", twice for the same day in two forms. The owner surface adds a fourth grammar for a single instant: "Live since 15 July" in the share line and "Updated 15 July 2026" in the footer are the same timestamp printed two ways on one page. Each instance is small; together they are the signature of strings written per component rather than edited as one document.
Proposed fix: Delete the .b-todayLabel node from horizon() at every medium — states.loading builds its own copy inline and keeps it, so the unanchored-time rule still holds where there is no rail. The rail marker at the head of the measure becomes the single statement of today, and it already sits where the reading starts. On print, render that marker as "Today" alone, since the unit line beneath the count already carries the dated form. In foot(), print the stamp through F.fmt.medium as "Updated 15 July", and pass stamp:false on the owner surface, where "Live since 15 July" already states that instant.

Score against this standard: the work of an award-winning design studio that
iterated on this product for months. 10 is that studio's best shipped work.
Benchmarks to hold it against, by name: Linear, Stripe, Vercel, xAI/Grok,
SpaceX. Score the ARTIFACT, not the effort. A polite 8 that should be a 6
makes the panel worthless.

WHAT YOU ARE REVIEWING
Signal Timeline is how one person hands another the plan for a day that
matters. An owner builds the plan; an audience — a couple, their families, a
venue — receives it as something finished. The flagship case is a wedding: the
owner is a planner or the couple themselves, and the people receiving it will
open it once, on a phone, probably while doing something else, and will judge
the whole company by that one screen. Everything from the owner's first empty
project to the printed keepsake on the morning itself is in scope. Timeline
goes first in a suite-wide redesign because it is the surface with the most
feeling in it; whatever wins here becomes the language Home, Notes and Tasks
adopt next.
The audience: Someone organising the most important day of their life, who has never used a.

CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE (do not propose breaking these):
- Palette is exactly 3 colours: Ink #111111, Indigo #4f46e5, White #ffffff, plus tints of those at
  stated alpha. NO other hue may be introduced. Status and hierarchy are
  expressed by ink density, weight and fill, not by colour.
- Type is Geist and Geist Mono at weights 400 and 600 only.
- The locked architecture:
  Nothing. This is greenfield.
- Protected objects (polish, never redesign):
  Nothing. Nothing is protected.
Findings that amount to "add a colour", "add a weight" or "restructure the
locked architecture" are out of scope and will be discarded.
Also out of scope for this engagement:
Auth, billing, the data model, performance work, marketing pages, and anything
in Tasks or Notes beyond noting what the suite will inherit.

MEASURED BASELINE. Two automated gates guard this master and both pass:
- C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\.claude\skills\elevate\scripts\audit.mjs --lab=C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08
  (palette lock, weights, families, WCAG AA contrast against the real
  composited backdrop, hit targets, radii, motion, type ramp, leading)
- C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08\interaction-check.mjs
READ the behaviour gate. Everything it asserts is already proven; a finding
that restates one of those assertions is worthless and will be refuted on
sight. Spend your findings on what automation cannot see.

Before scoring, also read the paid-for defect library at
C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\.claude\skills\elevate\references\lessons.md — those classes have
been found and fixed once already; check whether they are creeping back,
and spend the rest of your attention past them.

GRADE BY DRIVING, NOT ONLY BY READING FRAMES. Open the master in Playwright
(chromium; import { chromium } from "@playwright/test") at
file://C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08\master.html?v=approach&state=<state> and operate it:
tab through everything, press what looks pressable, exercise the keyboard
model end to end, resize across 390/768/1152/1279/1280/1440, and watch what every
repaint does to scroll position and focus.

Say plainly what this is: name the score, name what earned it, and name what
still stands between it and 9.5 in terms a founder can act on — is what
remains polish, a build, or a different decision, and roughly how big. Do not
inflate to be kind and do not deflate to look rigorous.

Refute if: it is factually wrong about the frames or the code; it is already handled; it would violate a non-negotiable constraint; it is taste stated as a defect with no argument; the fix would make the work worse; or it restates something the gates already prove. Confirm only if real, specific, and an improvement at a 9.5 bar. Echo the finding id back exactly so the verdict can be matched to its finding.
