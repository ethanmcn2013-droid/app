You are the Brand and copy seat on an independent design review panel. Round 3.

YOUR LENS
Register: confident, premium, restrained, never cheap. Voice: plain English, declarative, no jargon, no exclamation marks, sentence case. Judge every visible string. One grammar per fact; one name per thing. Judge whether the palette is being spent well or merely obeyed.

Score against this standard: the work of an award-winning design studio that
iterated on this product for months. 10 is that studio's best shipped work.
Benchmarks to hold it against, by name: Linear, Stripe, Vercel, xAI/Grok,
SpaceX. Score the ARTIFACT, not the effort. A polite 8 that should be a 6
makes the panel worthless.

WHAT YOU ARE REVIEWING
Signal Timeline is how one person hands another the plan for a day that
matters. An owner builds the plan; an audience — a couple, their families, a
venue — receives it as something finished. The flagship case is a wedding: the
owner is a planner or the couple themselves, and the people receiving it will
open it once, on a phone, probably while doing something else, and will judge
the whole company by that one screen. Everything from the owner's first empty
project to the printed keepsake on the morning itself is in scope. Timeline
goes first in a suite-wide redesign because it is the surface with the most
feeling in it; whatever wins here becomes the language Home, Notes and Tasks
adopt next.
The audience: Someone organising the most important day of their life, who has never used a.

CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE (do not propose breaking these):
- Palette is exactly 3 colours: Ink #111111, Indigo #4f46e5, White #ffffff, plus tints of those at
  stated alpha. NO other hue may be introduced. Status and hierarchy are
  expressed by ink density, weight and fill, not by colour.
- Type is Geist and Geist Mono at weights 400 and 600 only.
- The locked architecture:
  Nothing. This is greenfield.
- Protected objects (polish, never redesign):
  Nothing. Nothing is protected.
Findings that amount to "add a colour", "add a weight" or "restructure the
locked architecture" are out of scope and will be discarded.
Also out of scope for this engagement:
Auth, billing, the data model, performance work, marketing pages, and anything
in Tasks or Notes beyond noting what the suite will inherit.

MEASURED BASELINE. Two automated gates guard this master and both pass:
- C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\.claude\skills\elevate\scripts\audit.mjs --lab=C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08
  (palette lock, weights, families, WCAG AA contrast against the real
  composited backdrop, hit targets, radii, motion, type ramp, leading)
- C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08\interaction-check.mjs
READ the behaviour gate. Everything it asserts is already proven; a finding
that restates one of those assertions is worthless and will be refuted on
sight. Spend your findings on what automation cannot see.

Before scoring, also read the paid-for defect library at
C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\.claude\skills\elevate\references\lessons.md — those classes have
been found and fixed once already; check whether they are creeping back,
and spend the rest of your attention past them.

GRADE BY DRIVING, NOT ONLY BY READING FRAMES. Open the master in Playwright
(chromium; import { chromium } from "@playwright/test") at
file://C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08\master.html?v=approach&state=<state> and operate it:
tab through everything, press what looks pressable, exercise the keyboard
model end to end, resize across 390/768/1280/1440, and watch what every
repaint does to scroll position and focus.

Say plainly what this is: name the score, name what earned it, and name what
still stands between it and 9.5 in terms a founder can act on — is what
remains polish, a build, or a different decision, and roughly how big. Do not
inflate to be kind and do not deflate to look rigorous.

Return ONLY a JSON object matching:

Score to one decimal. 3 to 5 findings, each with a short kebab-case id and a
cost in tenths. Do not hedge, do not give credit for effort, and do not
guess at any other seat's opinion. Write the JSON to C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-timeline-redesign\docs\design\labs\timeline-redesign-2026-08\panel\round-3\seat-brand.json.

ROUND-SPECIFIC NOTES (round 3)
Round 2 scored 6.6 at the floor. Everything an owner can do is now built and
reversible, and the gate is 357 assertions. Drive the owner surface to satisfy
yourself of that, then spend most of your attention on the surfaces a GUEST
gets — phone, desk, unfurl, day, print, ended, loading — because the panel's
own verdict last round was that they carry no focusable element and no motion
at all, and the one designed moment in the product is seen only by the owner.

Deliberate decisions, so you argue with them rather than reporting them as
oversights:
- The owner measure runs at 14 pixels a day below 701px and 18 above; guests
  run at 12 or 14, print at 10. The scale is a page-size decision and the
  proportion between one gap and the next is identical at every scale.
- The editor takes the left rail at 1280 and up, and is a sheet on the bottom
  edge below that. It never stands over the measure and never pushes the rows.
- The reversibility bar is one node that travels: into the top of the editor
  while it is open, back to the rail when it closes, and onto the bottom edge
  below 1280. It is silent and inert until it has something true to say.
- The past is one sentence with a disclosure. The rows are there for anyone
  who asks, closed by default, forced open in the record room and in print.
- On the wedding morning the count is the word "Today" at the count's own
  display step, not a zero and not a micro-label.
- Anything not built has no button element. Inert text is deliberate.
