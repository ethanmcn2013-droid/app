Adversarially verify one design-review finding against the artifact. Default to REFUTED when uncertain.

FINDING id=best-week-line-has-no-name
Seat: Product taste and emotional resonance
Element: .record-tag inside .record, the dashed benchmark rule across the twelve-week plot
Problem: The label "Best week · 8" never paints. The `draw` keyframe ends on `clip-path: inset(0 0 0 0)`, and because `.record` is a 1px-tall border box that inset clips to a 1px strip — so the tag, which sits at `top: -18px`, is clipped out of existence. Animation values outrank the ordinary `[data-motion="settled"] .record { clip-path: none }` declaration, and `animation-fill-mode: both` keeps the final keyframe applied forever, so the tag is missing in every mode I drove: motion=play after the entrance finishes, motion=settled, prefers-reduced-motion, light and dark. The element measures 102.7 × 14.8px at (1162, 433) with visibility visible and opacity 1 — it is laid out and it is not on screen. Verified by pixel: the corner of the plot where it belongs is blank paper.
Consequence claimed: A dashed horizontal rule crosses the chart at two-thirds height with nothing naming it. The owner reads it as a target, an average, or a quota — the three things it is not. They cannot tell whether this week beat, met or missed anything, which is half the answer to the question the page exists to ask. The last beat of a 1.8-second entrance is a line wiping in to reveal a label that isn't there, so the choreography's payoff is an unexplained mark.
Severity claimed: misleading
Proposed fix: Move the label out of the animated element. Wrap the benchmark in a zero-height positioning parent that is not animated, animate only the rule itself, and hang `.record-tag` off the parent: `<span class="record-wrap" style="--r:…"><span class="record"></span><span class="record-tag t-label">Best week · 8</span></span>`, with `.record-wrap { position:absolute; left:0; right:0; bottom: calc(var(--r) * 1%); height:0; }`, `.record { position:absolute; inset:0; border-top:1px dashed var(--line); animation: draw …; }` and `.record-tag { position:absolute; right:0; top:-18px; }`. Give the tag its own fade so it arrives after the rule finishes wiping.

Score against this standard: the work of an award-winning design studio that
iterated on this product for months. 10 is that studio's best shipped work.
Benchmarks to hold it against, by name: Linear, Stripe, Vercel, xAI/Grok,
SpaceX. Score the ARTIFACT, not the effort. A polite 8 that should be a 6
makes the panel worthless.

WHAT YOU ARE REVIEWING
One owner, one Project, looking back over twelve weeks to answer one
question: **am I actually getting on top of this, or just busy?** Behind it:
what has quietly slipped while I wasn't looking, and is this stretch better
or worse than my normal.
The audience: A venue owner, wedding planner or small-studio operator — the 80% not in.

CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE (do not propose breaking these):
- Palette is exactly 18 colours: Ink #111111, Ink 2 (zinc 700) #3f3f46, Ink 3 (zinc 500) #71717a, Ink 4 (zinc 400) #a1a1aa, Ink 5 (zinc 300) #d4d4d8, Line (zinc 200) #e4e4e7, Paper 3 (zinc 100) #f4f4f5, Paper 2 #fafafa, Paper #ffffff, Indigo 600 #4f46e5, Indigo 500 #6366f1, Indigo 400 #818cf8, Amber 600 #d97706, Red 500 #ef4444, Emerald 600 #059669, Ground (dark) #0f0f10, Ground 2 (dark) #18181b, Ground 3 (dark) #27272a, plus tints of those at
  stated alpha. NO other hue may be introduced. Status and hierarchy are
  expressed by ink density, weight and fill, not by colour.
- Type is Geist and Geist Mono at weights 400 and 600 only.
- The locked architecture:
  - The route, the name and the place: `/app/home/analytics`, tab **Lately**,
    a tab strip beside Today's Signal and the Full Briefing. No rail icon, no
    wordmark, no marketing page.
  - The question, and the three movements.
  - The metric set. Seven real-now metrics used, two named as refusals, four
    cut. The table is `plan.html` §03. **A seat may not propose a metric that
    is not in that table.**
- Protected objects (polish, never redesign):
  - **The honest-degradation contract.** A missing source resolves to
    *unavailable*, never to a fabricated zero. A reader can never mistake "we
    don't know" for "it's zero".
  - **The "What this can't tell you" movement.** May be made more beautiful;
    may not be shrunk to a footnote or removed.
  - **The drawn-but-empty plot.** The trend the product cannot produce is
    drawn as the chart it would be.
  - **The partial-bucket treatment.** The current week is hatched and
    open-topped because the week is not over.
  - **The shared denominator.** All five KPI cards read the same 9.
Findings that amount to "add a colour", "add a weight" or "restructure the
locked architecture" are out of scope and will be discarded.

MEASURED BASELINE. Two automated gates guard this master and both pass:
- C:\Users\ethan\.claude\skills\elevate\scripts\audit.mjs --lab=C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-home-analytics\docs\design\labs\home-analytics-2026-08
  (palette lock, weights, families, WCAG AA contrast against the real
  composited backdrop, hit targets, radii, motion, type ramp, leading)
- C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-home-analytics\docs\design\labs\home-analytics-2026-08\interaction-check.mjs
READ the behaviour gate. Everything it asserts is already proven; a finding
that restates one of those assertions is worthless and will be refuted on
sight. Spend your findings on what automation cannot see.

Before scoring, also read the paid-for defect library at
C:\Users\ethan\.claude\skills\elevate\references\lessons.md — those classes have
been found and fixed once already; check whether they are creeping back,
and spend the rest of your attention past them.

GRADE BY DRIVING, NOT ONLY BY READING FRAMES. Open the master in Playwright
(chromium; import { chromium } from "@playwright/test") at
file://C:\Users\ethan\signal-studio-workspace\_wt-home-analytics\docs\design\labs\home-analytics-2026-08\lately.html?v=light&state=<state> and operate it:
tab through everything, press what looks pressable, exercise the keyboard
model end to end, resize across 390/768/1280/1440, and watch what every
repaint does to scroll position and focus.

Say plainly what this is: name the score, name what earned it, and name what
still stands between it and finished in terms a founder can act on — is what
remains polish, a build, or a different decision, and roughly how big. Do not
inflate to be kind and do not deflate to look rigorous.

HOW THIS ENGAGEMENT ENDS, so you know what your answer is for. It ends when
two consecutive rounds confirm no finding classed blocking or misleading,
both gates green, on a frozen surface. It does NOT end on a score, and your
score gates nothing — it is recorded and reported. That is deliberate:
across 45 recorded rounds, seven blind seats scoring one artifact disagree
with a standard deviation of 0.335, so a unanimous 9.5 would need true
quality of 9.94 to pass half the time and 10.23 to pass reliably, which is
off the scale. Score honestly and put your real weight into the severity
classes, because those are what actually decide when this stops.

Refute if: it is factually wrong about the frames or the code; it is already handled; it would violate a non-negotiable constraint; it is taste stated as a defect with no argument; the fix would make the work worse; or it restates something the gates already prove. Also judge the PROPOSED FIX, not only the problem: say what it would plausibly break, what must be re-measured after it lands, and whether its numbers are right against the real source. A correct problem with a wrong fix is REFUTED, with the corrected fix in sharpenedFix. Also judge the SEVERITY. An overstated class is a reason to refute the whole finding; an understated one is corrected in your reason. blocking = the product will not do what it says; misleading = the product asserts something untrue; defect = visibly wrong but passable; refinement = nothing is wrong. Confirm only if real, specific, and an improvement at the declared bar. Echo the finding id back exactly so the verdict can be matched to its finding.
